# Rivvi Voice AI Platform App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is an enterprise-grade voice AI platform designed to automate healthcare communication. The platform leverages Retell AI’s advanced voice technology to handle both outbound and inbound patient communications. It is built with a multi-tenant architecture that enforces strict role-based access whereby super admins, organization admins, and regular users have defined privileges. The main goal of the user journey is to allow organizations to create and manage campaigns, ingest patient data through Excel or CSV uploads, schedule call runs based on business rules like time zones and operational limits, and analyze the results through a unified analytics dashboard. Critical to this flow is the natural language input from users that guides campaign messaging without exposing the underlying prompt details or configuration. This document lays out the flow from onboarding through every key action and page transition in the platform.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user first visits the platform, they are greeted by a landing page that clearly explains the purpose of the voice AI solution for healthcare communications. The user can create an account on this page by providing their email address, name, and assigning an organization context. Multiple sign-up methods are supported, including email-based signup and social login options. Once the account is created along with the multi-tenant authentication layer, the user can log in through the dedicated login page. If a user forgets their password, an option to recover or reset it will guide them step by step through verifying their identity and regaining account access. Signing out is straightforward and accessible from any page after login, ensuring that user sessions are managed securely.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login, users are brought to the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the application. The homepage dynamically adapts to the user’s role, displaying different sections based on whether they are a super admin, organization admin, or a regular member. For super admins and organization admins, key options include access to campaign creation and configuration, data intake, scheduling for outbound calls, and a specialized configuration section for handling inbound call settings. Regular users see guidance on running campaigns and an overview of their recent activities. Prominent navigation menus, sidebar options, and headers allow users to easily transition to sections like data processing, call scheduling, iterative prompt refinement, and then on to detailed analytics and reporting.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the dashboard, the user can begin by selecting the campaign management section. This is where super admins first create and configure campaigns. The campaign creation page hides technical details such as the base prompt, while requiring the user to provide a natural language description for the campaign. The system uses this input along with a predefined base prompt (stored during campaign configuration) to dynamically generate a voice prompt. Behind the scenes, any changes are logged so that a change history is maintained. After campaign setup, the user moves to the data intake page. Here, they upload Excel or CSV files containing patient data and campaign-specific variables. An intelligent column mapping interface allows the user to match provided data columns to the dynamic variables expected by the system. The backend performs validations, ignores superfluous columns, and deduplicates patient records by checking against existing data across organizations.

Once the data is uploaded and mapped, users proceed to schedule and execute the campaign. On the scheduling page, the system displays available time slots guided by organization-specific business hours and time zone settings. Users have the option to start the campaign immediately if it is within allowed hours or schedule it for later. The run execution engine then batches outbound calls, applies concurrency limits based on organizational policies, and manages the call dispatch process. Throughout the process, WebSockets update the user interface in real time to reflect run status and call outcomes.

During an ongoing campaign run, users can provide iterative natural language input to tailor the campaign messaging. They enter their campaign intent in a dedicated area, for example describing an "urgent notice" scenario. This input is then combined with the static base prompt to generate an updated prompt for that specific run. The updated prompt, affecting both the conversation flow and the associated voicemail message in the Retell agent, is processed by a connected AI engine. This flow is designed so that the base prompt remains unchanged, and each new run creates a new iteration that is logged and trackable in a maintained change log. For inbound calls, a separate configuration page exists for the organization. Here, super admins can set up the single inbound campaign and define the dynamic variables that represent caller context and post-call data. When an inbound call webhook is triggered, the system identifies the patient using the phone number and previous interaction history, and the dynamic inbound prompt data is processed in a similar flexible manner as outbound data. Both inbound and outbound calls are displayed on the same unified analytics dashboard, allowing for comparative analysis of call performance.

## Settings and Account Management

Users are able to manage their personal information, update notification preferences, and view their role and organization details by accessing the account settings section accessible from any page through the main menu. Sensitive changes, such as modifying the campaign configuration details or editing the dynamic variable settings for posts calls, are restricted to super admins only. In this section, users can also update billing information or subscription preferences if needed. After saving any changes in the settings area, the application returns the user to their previous location, ensuring a smooth and connected navigation experience throughout the platform.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

At various points during the campaign creation, data upload, and scheduling processes, the application checks for errors such as invalid file formats, mismatched column names, or scheduling a run outside of business hours. If the user enters invalid data, clear error messages appear on the relevant page with guidance on how to correct the issue, such as remapping columns or uploading a properly formatted file. In cases of connectivity loss or system errors, the platform displays fallback pages that advise users to try again or contact support. Additionally, if a user attempts to access a restricted configuration page without proper privileges, the system directs them to a not-authorized page which explains the access restrictions. The design ensures that the user can always recover quickly and find a clear path back to normal application flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey for users of the Rivvi Voice AI Platform begins with a smooth onboarding experience guided by multi-tenant authentication. Once logged in, the main dashboard exposes key functions such as campaign creation, dynamic data intake, and scheduling of outbound calls. The detailed flow continues with the iterative refinement of campaign messaging via natural language input while maintaining a strict change log of prompt versions. Inbound call handling is streamlined through a separate configuration accessible only to super admins, yet seamlessly integrated into the unified analytics dashboard where both inbound and outbound call data are compared. Throughout the journey, error states are clearly communicated and managed, ensuring that users can always recover from issues. Overall, this platform provides a clear and connected experience from account creation to campaign execution and performance analysis, enabling efficient and effective automated healthcare communications.
